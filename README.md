- 👋 Hi, I’m @ontheboard ... this is a short reference to a chessboard.
- 👀 I’m interested in ... there's this huge temptation to type something ribald here.
- 👀 I’m interested in ... chess, (A)NN, programming, maths, languages.
- 👀 My main programming languages are ... C++ C# Java C Python Lua JavaScript.
- 👀 My main human languages are ... English, French, Spanish, German, Portuguese, Italian, but I've been known to splash around in other foreign waters too.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning ... everything. No really.
- 🌱 We should all be in a state of continuously growing the knowledge we have, and adding new branches/stems to it.
- 🌱 If I say 'I'm currently learning' something -- which is the site-suggested-topic for this profile-data -- it might/would imply I don't know an awful lot about it.
- 🌱 And that would be a false impression.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on ... nothing. Thanks.
- 📫 How to reach me ... don't. Thanks. But if you have to, I'm at the local chess club, most Fridays at 4pm. If I'm not there, then you have the wrong local chess club, right?
